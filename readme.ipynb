    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "The auction scheme works as follows. Each bidder $i$ has a private value $v_i$ known only to the bidder. $v_i$ is a bidding value that they will not exceed. If bidder $i$ wins and pays $p_i$, their utility is $v_i - p_i$. The utility is 0 when the bidder loses. Note that the bidders prefer losing than paying more than their value. \n",

    "A strategy for each bidder is a function, a plan for the game. This can be modeled as a normal form game, where these strategies are pure strategies. \n",
